Options, futures and US open-end mutual fund transactions settle on trade date plus one business day. (Some exchanges and other transaction types may have longer or shorter settlement periods.) Ending settled cash reflects the cash that has actually settled.  Execution time will be furnished upon request.</li><li>Initial and maintenance margin requirements are available within the Account Window of the Trader Workstation.</li><li>Interactive Brokers LLC receives compensation from fund companies in connection with the purchase and holding of fund shares by customers of Interactive Brokers LLC.

If an IB affiliate is acting as riskless principal in connection with filling the fractional share portion of your order, the affiliate will execute the fractional share portion of your order at the price it receives for the execution of the whole share.</li><li>In case of partial executions, commissions are charged on the total quantity executed on the original order.
